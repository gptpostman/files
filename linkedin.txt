====================

* under about this was there 
I’m a backend developer with hands-on experience building scalable APIs, integrating with CMS platforms, and working across complex data environments. With a strong foundation in Python (Flask), Node.js, and SQL/NoSQL systems, I focus on delivering backend solutions that are secure, efficient, and production-ready.

At Avo Automation, I’ve contributed to backend development, data masking, and CI/CD implementation across two major platforms—working closely with product leads, architects, and DevOps engineers to support customer-facing environments and large-scale data migrations.

Previously, I led API development for global CMS integrations across 90+ websites at AkzoNobel and P&G, helping teams improve content delivery, security, and system reliability.

I enjoy working in cross-functional teams, solving real-world problems, and continuously improving system performance through automation and clean architecture.

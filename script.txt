“Currently, I’m working at Avo Automation as a Backend & DevOps Engineer, contributing across two major projects.

The first is a Test Data Management platform where I’ve been building RESTful APIs using Python and Flask. A key part of my work involves integrating with various data sources—SQL, NoSQL, and file systems—to streamline test data provisioning. I also implemented dynamic data masking for MySQL and PostgreSQL to improve security and data governance. We use PySpark for data engineering tasks, and I work closely with the product team and architects on overall system design.

The second project is a platform called BVO Bssure, where I’ve been focused on stabilizing Node.js APIs and improving their reliability for production use.

Apart from development, I’m also involved in DevOps tasks like managing CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps and handling large-scale MongoDB data migrations from legacy to new schemas—mostly for production environments.

Overall, my role is quite hands-on and spans backend development, data handling, security, and deployment automation.”
